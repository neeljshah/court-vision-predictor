# Data Schema — NBA AI Basketball System

This document describes every data point tracked or collected by the system, what it means, and how it is used in models and analytics.

## 9. PostgreSQL Schema — `database/schema.sql`

Nine tables designed for production-scale storage of all system outputs.

```sql
-- Key table relationships
teams (team_id PK)
    ← players (team_id FK)
    ← games (home_team_id, away_team_id FK)

games (game_id PK)
    ← tracking_frames (game_id FK)
    ← possessions (game_id FK)
    ← shots (game_id FK)
    ← game_lineups (game_id FK)
    ← model_predictions (game_id FK)

players (player_id PK)
    ← tracking_frames (player_id FK)
    ← shots (player_id FK)
    ← player_identity_map (player_id FK)
```

**Indexes:** `game_date`, `team_id`, `player_id`, `season` — optimized for dashboard queries, lineup lookups, and model backtests.

## Key Data Quality Notes

1. **Shot enrichment gap**: 0 of 17 tracked shots have been enriched with NBA PBP outcomes yet — requires running `run_clip.py --game-id [id]` on a real game clip. Planned for Phase 6.

2. **Identity resolution**: Jersey OCR resolves ~70% of players per clip in good lighting. Unknown players are tracked with anonymous IDs (`unknown_N`) and linked to rosters manually in `data/player_identity_map.json`.

3. **Court coordinate accuracy**: Current SIFT homography gives ±12-15 inches spatial accuracy. Phase 2.5 pose estimation (ankle keypoints) will improve this to ±6-8 inches.

4. **PBP coverage**: 3,627/3,685 games (98.4%) have play-by-play data. Remaining 58 are preseason games.

5. **Shot chart coverage**: 221,866 shots from 569 players across 3 seasons. Each shot has: zone, distance, shot type, action type, and made/missed label — ready for xFG v1 training.
